Neural Networks in Python
============================================
* Library for implementing Artificial Neural Networks of any form in Python *

Currently, this library is not yet functional. A majority of the code has been written, but testing remains to be done.

** TODO:**
- Finish constrcutor in NeuralNetwork class
- Develop code for handling cyclic neurons (ie, neurons which reference themseleves)
- Develop code for arctanh species neuron
- DEBUG 
- *** Do interesting things wtih real-world datasets!***
