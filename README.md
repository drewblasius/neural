Neural Networks in Python
============================================
* Library for implementing Artificial Neural Networks of any form in Python *

Currently testing NeuralNetwork. Can implement cyclic/acyclic networks of aribtrary size, but does not provide functionality for adding/removing connections or neurons. This is to be added in future versions.


**TODO**:
* Finish NeuralNetwork constructor
* Add code for network setup (ie. choosing/setting up neuron types)
* Debug NeuralNetwork class
* Add code for radial basis networks
* Debug/verify backpropagation
  * Train with identity function
