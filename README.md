Neural Networks in Python
============================================
* Library for implementing Artificial Neural Networks of any form in Python *

Currently, this library is not yet functional. A majority of the code has been written, but testing remains to be done.

* TODO *:

1 Finish NeuralNetwork constructor
2 Add code for network setup (ie. choosing/setting up neuron types)
3 Debug NeuralNetwork class
4 Add code for radial basis networks


- *** Do interesting things wtih real-world datasets!***
